   - Cite specific code sections: "amends 30 USC §1337 (Outer Continental Shelf
     Lands Act)" or "amends 26 USC §45Q (Carbon Capture Tax Credit)"
   - Distinguish NEW provisions from AMENDMENTS to existing law from REPEALS
   - Note any SUNSET provisions or expiration dates
   - Identify if bill creates new regulatory authority or modifies existing

3. MANDATORY vs PERMISSIVE LANGUAGE
